###Overview

This project serves as a tutorial. Full blog here:

It was bootstrapped using `create-react-app` and uses `redux` as well.

It includes one functional component that uses the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks provided by `react-redux`.

Tests are written using `enzyme` and `jest` (which comes along with `create-react-app`).
